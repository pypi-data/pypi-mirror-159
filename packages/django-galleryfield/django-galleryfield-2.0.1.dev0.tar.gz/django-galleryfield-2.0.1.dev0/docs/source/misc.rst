FAQs
**********
- Q: Why there isn't a delete view for image in the widget?

- A: Image upload behavior is much more complex than generic form views. Actually, the `jQuery File Upload <https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options>`_
  has a working delete button, but we changed it to an UI behavior of remove an instance from the gallery (no physical deletion),
  considered the following situations:

  - For the simplest case, when a user navigate away before saving the gallery they have just uploaded,
    it's almost impossible to delete those images from client side.

  - Another situations happens when a gallery field is a required field. If there exists a delete view for the image instance,
    when a user tries to delete ALL the images he/she had previously saved, from the UI, and then he/she submit the form.
    Undoubtedly, the form will raise an invalid error, and the ``GalleryField`` of the gallery instance won't get updated.
    However, since all the image instances have been deleted before form submission,
    the form will then display broken images after reloading.

  - When an image presents in different galleries/albums, deletion of the image from one gallery
    will make it a broken image when view other galleries which contain it.

  To avoid such situations, our suggestion is not to provide a delete view,
  but a strategy to identify ``orphaned`` image model instances, and
  delete them with a cron task: create an ``M2M`` relationship between the image models and the
  gallery models. Through ``post-save`` signals of the gallery model, we are able to update the ``M2M`` relationship
  between all image model instances and related gallery model instances. In this way, image model instances which were not
  involved in any ``M2M`` relationship can be identified as ``orphaned`` images, the deletion of which are accurate and easy.
  The ``demo_custom.receivers`` might provide a feasible solution for the issue. Other suggestions are also appreciated.


TODOs
**********

-  More detailed Documentation
-  Gif not client side croppable (don't show crop button)
-  Scale large images in crop UI

Known issues
********************

-  Currently, it's hard (although not impossible) to use the widget in a Non-model formfield.
-  CSS rendering of buttons in Admin.
-  Gif will be converted to png (to retain gif, you need to set ``disableImageResize`` to ``False`` in ``jquery_fileupload_ui_options`` when initializing ``GalleryWidget``).
-  Doesn't support svg because django ImageField can't handle svg images.

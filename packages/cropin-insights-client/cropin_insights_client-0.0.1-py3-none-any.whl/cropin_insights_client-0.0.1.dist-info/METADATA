    ## Introduction to PlotRisk  PlotRisk is a module, which ease to create plot for the given area of interest and also   facilitate to check satellite indices, weather and yield data.    **Note**&#x60;&#x60;  Indices, Weather and Yield data can be accessed based on features subscriptions.  &#x60;&#x60;  ## Resources  A resource is an entity that has a set of exposed operations. The entity can represent an actual object (account, users..) or a set of logical operations collated together. It is up to the specification user to decide whether sub-resources should be referred to as part of their main resource or as a resource of their own. For example, assume the following URL set:     &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;    /users         -GET                   POST                    /users/{id}    -GET                   PATCH                   DELETE   &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  For more details, see [CRUD Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis-administration/api/crud) to learn more about it.  ## Trying the API  You can use [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) or any third party client such as ,[Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [cURL](https://curl.se/) etc. to test the REST API.    **Swagger UI**    **Step 1.** Generate access tokens using **/token** resource      **Info** : &#x60;&#x60;If you are a SMARTFARM_PLUS user, you can request for tokens using tenant,username,password  &#x60;&#x60;    **Step 2.** Copy **_access_token_** from **Step 1**, then click on **Authorize** button and paste the token.    **Step 3.** Select an API resource and click on **_Try it out_**.    **Step 4.** Fill the headers such as _**TenantType**_, _**OrgId**_ &amp; _**X-Api-Key**_.    **Info** : &#x60;&#x60;X-Api-Key can be obtained from Step 1  &#x60;&#x60;    **Step 5.**  Query parameters are optional.

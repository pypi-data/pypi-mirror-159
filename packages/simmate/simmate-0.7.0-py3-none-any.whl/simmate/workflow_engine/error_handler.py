    Abstract base class for an ErrorHandler. These handlers should be used in
    combination with S3Tasks.

    As an example of creating a custom error handler for your tasks:
    ``` python
    from simmate.workflow_engine import ErrorHandler

    class ExampleHandler(ErrorHandler):

        filename_to_check = "output.txt"
        possible_error_messages = ["There's an error here!"]

        # want a different kind of check, you can override this method.
        #
        # def check(self, directory):
        #     ... do some check and return true if there's an error
        #     return True

    This class property indicates whether the error handler is a monitor,
    i.e., a handler that monitors a job as it is running. If a
    monitor-type handler notices an error, the job will be sent a
    termination signal, the error is then corrected,
    and then the job is restarted. This is useful for catching errors
    that occur early in the run but do not cause immediate failure.
    Also, is_monitor=True and is_terminating=False is a special case. See the
    is_terminating description below for why!

    Whether this handler terminates a job upon error detection. By
    default, this is True, which means that the current Job will be
    stopped when an error is found, then the corrections are applied,
    and job restarted. In some instances, some errors may not need the job to be
    terminated or may need to wait for some other event to terminate a job.
    For example, a particular error may require a flag to be set to request
    a job to terminate gracefully once it finishes its current task. The
    handler to set the flag should be classified as is_terminating = False to
    not terminate the job.

    def check(self, directory: str) -> bool:
        """
        This method is called during the job (for monitors) or at the end of
        the job to check for errors. It searches for errors and returns the
        error (or list of errors) for correct() method to use. If there are no
        errors, then None (or an empty list) will be returned. In many cases,
        you should read through the files directly rather than use
        calculators.example.outputs which in many cases assumes a completed file.

        As some example, ErrorHandler's can have `check` functions that do one
        of the following:

        1. returns True when the error is there and False otherwise
        2. the ErrorHandler includes variations of a particular error, where
            it returns a label such as "Scenario 2" that .correct() can use.
            And in cases where there's no error, either False or None is returned.

        This method can be overwritten, but we have a "default" function that
        addresses the most common use-case. Here, we have a series of error messages
        and a specific file that they need to be checked in. This default method uses
        self.filename_to_check and self.possible_error_messages to check for an
        error. It then returns True if the errors is found and False otherwise.

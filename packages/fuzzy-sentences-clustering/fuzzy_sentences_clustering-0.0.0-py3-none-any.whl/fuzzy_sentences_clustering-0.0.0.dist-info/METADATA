fuzzy-sentences-clustering
==========================

Clustering similar sentences based on their fuzzy similarity.

Purpose of the Package
----------------------

There are some popular algorithms on the market for mining topics in a
textual set, such as
`LDA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation>`__, but
they don’t work very well for a small set of data, let’s say a thousand
sentences for example.

This package tries to solve this for a small dataset by making the
following naive assumption:

   *If I remove all the stopwords between two sentences, extract the
   stems of their words and after that find similar phrases between
   these two sentences, they are probably talking about the same, or
   similar, subject.*

The goal here is to form clusters/groups with at least two similar
sentences, isolated sentences (sentences that don’t look like any other
in the total set) will not generate a cluster just for them. For these
cases, the sentence will receive the *-1* tag.

For while it works just for **portuguese** language.

Installation
------------

You can install it using pip:

.. code:: bash

   pip3 install fuzzy-sentences-clustering

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

   >>> from fuzzy_sentences_clustering import look_for_clusters
   >>> sentences = ["morava em florianópolis", "comprar um carro", "compra de um carro", "em florianópolis eu moro", "gosto de samba", "quero comer tapioca"]
   >>> res = look_for_clusters(sentences=sentences, similarity_threshold=90)
   >>> print(res)
   output: [1, 2, 2, 1, -1, -1]

django-htmx-refresh
===================

This is a Django app to handle full-page reloads with HTMX.

There are two possible use-cases for this app.

Quick start
-----------

1. django-htmx-refresh relies on the django-htmx package. You can
   install it with pip:

::

       pip install django-htmx

2. Add “django_htmx_refresh” to your INSTALLED_APPS setting:

::

       INSTALLED_APPS = [
           ...
           'django_htmx_refresh',
       ]

3. Include an app namespace for your project’s urls:

::

       path('app_path', include(('app.urls', 'app_namespace'))),

Middleware
~~~~~~~~~~

For when you want to handle htmx requests in all the views of a
particular app.

4. Create a new list in your settings called HTMX_APPS:

::

       HTMX_APPS = [
           'app_namespace'
       ]

This is so our custom middleware class only affects apps we explicity
define, preventing errors with other third-party apps such as the
default django admin application.

5. Add HtmxResponseMiddleware to the MIDDLEWARE setting:

::

       MIDDLEWARE = [
           ...
           'django_htmx_refresh.middleware.HtmxResponseMiddleware',
       ]

**Note**: The ``HtmxReseponseMiddleware`` class provided with this
application uses the ``process_template_response`` hook, meaning any
view you intend to be used with this class must return a response object
that implements a ``render`` method. Luckily Django’s class-based views
do this for us with ``TemplateResponse``.

Mixin
~~~~~

For when you want to handle htmx requests in most of your views but not
necessarily all of them.

4. Import the HtmxResponseMixin and add it to your view(s).

::

       from django_htmx_refresh.mixins import HtmxResponseMixin

       class ExampleView(TemplateView, HtmxResponseMixin):
           template_name = 'template_name.html'

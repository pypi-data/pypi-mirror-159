TableParser

tableParser is a python program using the concept of deep learning for extract the data from tables present in the PDF. It basically takes the file name of the pdf and extrcts the tables from the PDF. This is usefull when we need tables of the reserch papers or some thing like long table. This program uses the pytorch framework (made by facebook) and tesseract for parsing the table data.

This is an Intital stage of the project. It have some bugs hopefully later release will fix this issue. ðŸ˜Š

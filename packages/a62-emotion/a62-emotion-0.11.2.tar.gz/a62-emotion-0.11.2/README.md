## Features

Give audio and text as input and get back the dominant emotion.

## Usage/Examples

Be sure to add double quotes to lines containing one or more commas for `.csv` files.

For graphical interface, use https://a62-emotion.herokuapp.com/index and upload `.wav` and `.csv` files.

```python
In [1]: import requests

In [2]: with open("./data/raw_sample/audio/UlTJmndbGHM.wav", "rb") as fd:
   ...:     response = requests.post("https://a62-emotion.herokuapp.com/predict", files={'files[]': fd})
   ...:

In [3]: response.json()
Out[3]: {'predictions_audio': {'UlTJmndbGHM.wav': 'positive'}, 'predictions_texte': {}}
```

```bash
curl -F 'files[]=@/home/user/emotion/data/raw_sample/audio/DatH-ra0VKY.wav' -F 'files[]=@/home/user/file.csv' https://a62-emotion.herokuapp.com/predict
{"predictions_audio":{"DatH-ra0VKY.wav":"positive"},"predictions_texte":{"file.csv":{"DAMON WILLIAMS: I am the Senior Vice President and Chief Education and Youth Development Officer for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.":"neutral","In that role, I help to shape the education policy and youth development direction for more than 4,000 clubs that are part of our federated network, having an impact on more than 4 million young people across this nation.":"positive"}}}

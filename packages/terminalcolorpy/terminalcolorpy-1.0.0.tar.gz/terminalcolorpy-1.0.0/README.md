# Overview

This is a package that utilizes ANSI escape sequences to colorize your stdout, terminal, printed messages and what not. The key-features include,

- Fully tested with pytest
- Fully documented & type-hinted
- Dependency-free

# Installation

> The required Python version for this module is 3.10 or above

```
# Linux/MacOS
python3 -m pip install terminalcolorpy

The package consists of a few functions which are explained down below. In case your terminal

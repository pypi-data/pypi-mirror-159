These are few source files from my matlab codebase from my original implementation of hiwenet, to give an idea of core computation. 

Please be advised that this code is not meant to work out of the box (like the python package here), just shared to enable matlab users to get started faster, if they so insist on doing it in matlab. I unfortunately do not have time to maintain or document matlab code, as I am moving away from it 100% (which I strongly advise you do also).

Histogram distance implementation is based on the toolbox below:

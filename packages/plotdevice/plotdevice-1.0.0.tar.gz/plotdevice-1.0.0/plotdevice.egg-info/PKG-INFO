Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

PlotDevice is a Macintosh application used for computational graphic design. It
provides an interactive Python environment where you can create two-dimensional
graphics and output them in a variety of vector, bitmap, and animation formats.
It is meant both as a sketch environment for exploring generative design and as
a general purpose graphics library for use in external Python programs.

PlotDevice scripts can create images from simple geometric primitives, text, and
external vector or bitmap images. Drawing commands provide a thin abstraction
over macOS's Quartz graphics engine, providing high-quality rendering
of 2D imagery and powerful compositing operations.

PlotDevice is a fork of NodeBox 1.9.7rc1 with support for modern versions of
Python and Mac OS.

The new version features:

* Runs natively on Intel and Apple Silicon and supports retina displays
* Python 3 only (including a bundled 3.10 installation in the app)
* images can now be exported in HEIC format and videos support H.265 (HEVC)
* SVG files can now be drawn to the canvas using the `image()` command (thanks to the magical [SwiftDraw](https://github.com/swhitty/SwiftDraw) library)
* image exports have a configurable `zoom` to create 2x/3x/etc ‘retina’ images
* revamped `var()` command for creating GUIs to modify values via sliders, buttons, toggles, etc.
* updated text editor with multiple tabs, new themes, and additional key-binding modes emulating Sublime Text and VS Code
* the module's command line interface is now accessible through `python3 -m plotdevice`
* the command line tool has a new `--install` option to download [PyPI](https://pypi.org) packages for use within the app
* document autosaving is now user-configurable
* Bugfixes and misc. improvements detailed in the [changelog](https://github.com/plotdevice/plotdevice/blob/main/CHANGES.md)

Version 0.9.5 added:

* Python 3 compatible
* Can now be built with system Python or Homebrew versions of the interpreter
* Much faster import times on Yosemite thanks to a bundled copy of PyObjC 3.0.4
* HTTP is now handled by the ``requests`` module and caches responses locally
* Totally revamped typography system with support for OpenType features,
  pagination, multi-column text, character geometry, and more
* Added 130+ unit tests (run them with ``python setup.py test``) plus bugfixes for
  for ``measure()``, ``textpath()``, ``Bezier.fit()``, ``read()``, and the Preferences dialog

Version 0.9.4 added:

* Enhanced command line interface.
* New text editor with tab completion, syntax color themes, and emacs/vi bindings.
* Video export in H.264 or animated gif formats (with GCD-based i/o).
* Added support for external editors by reloading the source when changed.
* Build system now works with Xcode or ``py2app`` for the application and ``pip`` for the module.
* Virtualenv support (for both installation of the module and running scripts with dependencies).
* External scripts can use ``from plotdevice import *`` to create a drawing environment.
* Simplified bezier & affine transform api using the python ‘with’ statement
* New compositing operations for blend mode, global opacity, and dropshadows
* Simplified typography commands with stylesheet-based character styles
* Now uses the system's Python 2.7 interpreter.

Requirements:

* Mac OS X 11+
* Python 3.6+

# AMQP Internal Library
[![PyPI version shields.io](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cosecurity-amqp-lib.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/cosecurity-amqp-lib/) <br>
Internal library for exchanging messages between services instantiated in the AWS environment. 
The base used for the elaboration of the package was the PIKA library developed by the RabbitMQ team.

## Installation
To use the library it is necessary to have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on the machine and run the following command:
```bash
python3 -m pip install cosecurity-amqp-lib
```

## Environment Variables File
- `AMQP_USER` user for connecting to RabbitMQ
- `AMQP_PASSWORD` password for connecting to RabbitMQ
- `[SERVICE_NAME]` service name and respective service queue name, can be more than one 
- `AMQP_SOCKET_TIMEOUT` socket connect timeout in seconds
- `AMQP_HEARTBEAT` AMQP connection heartbeat timeout value for negotiation during connection tuning or callable which is invoked during connection tuning

### if it is a local instance:
- `AMQP_HOST` host to connect to RabbitMQ, if localhost does not need to fill the port

### if the connection is via Amazon MQ:
- `AMQP_BROKER_ID` amqp id inside aws
- `AWS_REGION` region where amqp is allocated within aws

## Consumers 
Consumers are instances that monitor a specific queue, and if there is a change in the queue, they perform a certain action.<br>
In this library a consumer can have more than one action/method, called `primitive`. In addition, each action will still have its default input set.
Each method that must be an action must be registered so that it can be triggered if there is a change in the directed queue.<br>
Below is an example of how to create a consumer class:
```python
from typing import Any, Dict
from cosecurity_amqp_lib.consumer import Consumer

class ConsumerExample(Consumer):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__(
            name='example'
        )
        self.register(self.primitive_one)
        self.register(self.primitive_two)
        self.start()
    
    def primitive_one(self, content:Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        print(content['hello'])
    
    def primitive_two(self, content:Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        print(content['message'])
```

## Producers
Producers are responsible for producing and/or posting new messages in consumer queues. <br>
In the internal library the producers are called `stub`, I try their methods defined and typed based on what has already been defined as `primitive` in their consumer.<br>
Below is an example of how to create a `stub` inside the library in the [stub.py file](https://github.com/CoSecurity/amqp-internal-library/blob/main/cosecurity_amqp_lib/stub.py):
```python
class ExampleStub(Stub):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            destination='example'
        )

    def primitive_one(self) -> None:
        self._send(
            primitive='primitive_one',  
            content={
                'hello': 'word'
            }
        )

    def primitive_two(self, message:str) -> None:
        self._send(
            primitive='primitive_two',  
            content={
                'message': message
            }
        )
```
Now, an example of how to use an already created `stub` and publish it in the library in Pypi:
```python
from cosecurity_amqp_lib.stub import ExampleStub

example_stub = ExampleStub()
example_stub.primitive_one()
example_stub.primitive_two(message='Hello world!')
```

## Additional arguments for queues
In the creation of the consumers it is possible to pass some additional configurations for the creation of the queue, these configurations can be found on the official RabbitMQ website. Below is a representation of how to pass an additional argument:
```python
class ConsumerExample(Consumer):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        [...]
        self.start(
            arguments={
                'x-queue-mode': 'lazy'
            }
        )
```

## Example
In the [example/simple](https://github.com/CoSecurity/amqp-internal-library/tree/main/example/simple) 
folder we have a real case example of a `stub` sending an string to a consumer.

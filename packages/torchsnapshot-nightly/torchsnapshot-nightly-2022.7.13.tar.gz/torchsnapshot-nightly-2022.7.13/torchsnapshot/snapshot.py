class Snapshot:
    """
    Snapshot represents the persisted program state at one point in time.

    Basic usage:
    ::
        # Define the program state
        app_state = {"model": model, "optimizer": optimizer"}

        # At an appropriate time, persist the program state as a snapshot
        snapshot = Snapshot.take(path=path, app_state=app_state)

        # On resuming, restore the program state from a snapshot
        snapshot.restore(app_state)

    Overview:

        At high level, torchsnapshot saves each value in state dicts as a
        file/object in the corresponding storage system. It also saves a manifest
        describing the persisted values and the structure of the original state
        dict.

        Comparing with func:`torch.save` and func:`torch.load`, torchsnapshot:

        - Enables efficient random access of persisted model weights.
        - Accelerates persistence by parallelizing writes.
            - For replicated values, persistence is parallelized across ranks.
        - Enables flexible yet robust elasticity (changing world size on
          restore).

    Elasticity:

        Elasticity is implemented via correctly making persisted values
        available to a newly joined rank, and having it correctly restores the
        corresponding runtime objects from the persisted values.

        For the purpose of elasticity, all persisted values fall into one of
        the categories in [per-rank, replicated, sharded].

        per-rank:
            By default, all non-sharded values are treated as per-rank.
            On save, the value is only saved by the owning rank.
            On load, the value is only made available to the same rank.

        replicated:
            A user can suggest any non-sharded value as replicated via glob
                patterns.
            On save, the value is only saved once (can be by any rank).
            On load, the value is made available to all ranks, including newly
                joined ranks.

        sharded:
            Specific types are always treated as sharded (e.g. ShardedTensor).
            On save, all shard-owning ranks save their shards.
            On load, all shards are made available to all ranks, including
                newly joined rank. All ranks can read from all shards for
                restoring the runtime object from persisted values.
                (ShardedTensor resharding is powered by torch.dist.checkpoint).

        If all values within a snapshot are either replicated or sharded, the
        snapshot is automatically reshard-able.

        If a snapshot contains per-rank values, it cannot be resharded unless
        the per-rank values are explicitly coerced to replicated on load.

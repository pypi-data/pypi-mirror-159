# Flatex
This is inspired by the C program "flatex" for flattening a LaTex project that uses include statements. It is not a fully backwards compatible bug for bug re-implementation.

## Basic usage
The basic way to use this program is to navigate to the directory with your highest level .tex file and simply call 

```
python3 -m flatex <top_level.tex>
```

Then this program will output a fully expanded version

## Caveats
This will not handle nested include statements

## Testing
To run unit tests run the following command from the root of the project
```
python3 -m unittest tests.test_flatex
```

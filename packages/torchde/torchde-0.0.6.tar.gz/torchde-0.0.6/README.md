# Torch Density Estimation
Generic implementation of Deep Neural Networks for Density Estimation in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PytorchLightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/). 

## Installation
In order to network implementations install `torchde` via pip:
```shell
pip install torchde
```
In case you wish to employ the training procedures and datamodule implementations (on top of `pytorch-lightning`), you would need to install the additional tools as well:

```shell
pip install "torchde[tools]"
```

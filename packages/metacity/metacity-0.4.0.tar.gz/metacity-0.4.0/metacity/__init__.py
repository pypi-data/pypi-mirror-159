Metacity is a library for creating and manipulating city objects. It supports the following formats: GeoJSON and Shapefile. City objects are represented as an array of objects, each of which has a set of properties. The properties include a geometry, and a set of metadata. The appearance of the city objects is defined by a set of styles. The styles are specified with a custom language. The library is designed to be extensible, so that new types of objects and styles can be added.

# Cybernetic Kit

The Cybernetic Kit is a set of conventions and techniques useful for making software-driven social impact. This repository holds a collection of software components for multiple fields of study, such as:

- Open Data & Civic Engagement
- Environmental Science
- Library Science
- Software Development
- Sociology
- Neuroscience

### Data Objects

Data Objects are Python classes designed to make it easier to interact with data. Using Data Objects to describe something of interest tells computers how to manipulate, archive, inspect, and exchange data.

#### Built-In Data Objects

- civic data
- research preprints and archives
- air quality sensor readings
- geopolitical shapes (e.g., county, state)


**How to use built-in Data Objects**

Here's an example of how you'd go about storing air quality sensor readings in Elasticsearch.

```python
from datetime import datetime

from elasticsearch_dsl import connections
from cybernetickit.sensor import AirQuality
from cybernetickit import constants

connections.create_connection(hosts=['localhost'], timeout=20)

observation = AirQuality(date=datetime.now(),
                         state='ga',
                         pollutant=constants.OZONE._asdict(),
                         units=constants.OZONE.units,
                         concentration=2.3)

observation.save()
```

You can use the Elasticsearch DSL to search and aggregations against an existing Elasticsearch index:

```python
from elasticsearch_dsl import Q
s = AirQuality.search(Q('match', state='ny') & Q('match', **{'pollutant.parameter': 'OZONE'}))
response = s.execute()

for obs in response:
    ...
```

#### Custom Data Objects

Simply subclass the `CoreModel` and describe something of interest. Use annotations for runtime validation:

```python
from typing from List, Optional
from cybernetickit from CoreModel, Keyword


class UseOfForce(CoreModel):
    force_applied: str = Keyword()
    deadly_force: Optional[str] = Keyword()
    source_ref: str = Keyword()
    target_ref: str = Keyword()

```



## Getting Started

```sh
pip install cybernetickit
```

```python
from cybernetickit import CoreModel
```

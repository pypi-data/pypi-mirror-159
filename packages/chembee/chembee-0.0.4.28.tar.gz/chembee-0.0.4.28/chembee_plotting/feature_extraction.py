def plot_feature_importances(result_json: dict, file_name: str, prefix: str):
    """
    The plot_feature_importances function plots the feature importances of a random forest model.
    It takes three arguments:
        - forest_importances: The feature importances from the random forest model, as returned by sklearn's .feature_importance() method.
        - std: The standard deviation of the feature importances, as returned by sklearn's .std() method on a RandomForestRegressor or RandomForestClassifier object.  This is used to plot error bars for each importance value.  If no standard deviation is available (i.e., if you are using a DecisionTreeRegressor or DecisionTreeClassifier), set this to None (the default).
        - file_name: A string containing the name of your desired output file (e.g., "FeatureImportancePlot" will result in "FeatureImportancePlotRFModelNameHere").

    :param forest_importances: Used to pass the feature importances to the function.
    :param std: Used to plot the standard deviation of the feature importances.
    :param file_name:std: Used to pass the file name of the plot to be saved.
    :param prefix:std: Used to specify the prefix for the file name.
    :return: The feature importances of the forest.

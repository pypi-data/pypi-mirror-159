.. note::

    * For the Python/PyPy versions indicated by |y| in the above, this package can be installed using either ``pip`` or ``conda`` (see :ref:`installation instructions <InstallationMethods>` below.)
    * This package cannot be installed via ``pip`` or ``conda`` on the Python/PyPy versions indicated by |n| in the above table.
    * To install on the older Python 3 versions that are not listed in the above (for example Python 3.5), build this package from the source code (see :ref:`build instructions <Build_Locally>`).

.. _InstallationMethods:

=================
Install from PyPi
=================

|pypi| |format| |implementation| |pyversions|

The recommended installation method is through the package available at `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/detkit>`_ using `pip`.

1. Ensure `pip` is installed within Python and upgrade the existing ``pip`` by

   ::

       python -m ensurepip
       python -m pip install --upgrade pip

   If you are using PyPy instead of Python, ensure `pip` is installed and upgrade the existing `pip` by

   ::

       pypy -m ensurepip
       pypy -m pip install --upgrade pip

2. Install this package in Python by
   
   ::
       
       python -m pip install detkit

   or, in PyPy by

   ::
       
       pypy -m pip install detkit

.. _Install_Conda:

===========================
Install from Anaconda Cloud
===========================

|conda-version| |conda-platform|

Alternatively, the package can be installed through `Anaconda could <https://anaconda.org/s-ameli/detkit>`_.

* In **Linux** and **Windows**:
  
  ::
      
      conda install -c s-ameli detkit

* In **macOS**:
  
  ::
      
      conda install -c s-ameli -c conda-forge detkit

.. _Build_Locally:

======================
Build from Source Code
======================

|release|

**Build dependencies:** To build the package from the source code, `numpy` and `cython` are required. These dependencies are installed automatically during the build process and no action is needed.

1. Install GCC compiler as follows.

   * **Linux:** Install `gcc`, for instance, by `apt` (or any other package manager on your Linux distro)

     ::

         sudo apt install gcc

   * **macOS:** Install `gcc` via Homebrew:

     ::

         sudo brew install gcc

   * **Windows:** Install `Microsoft Visual C++ compiler <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/>`_. Open the command prompt (where you will enter the installation commands in the next step) and load the Intel compiler variables by

     ::

         C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat

     You may set this directory accordingly to the directory of your Intel compiler.

2. Clone the source code and install this package by
   
   ::

       git clone https://github.com/ameli/detkit.git
       cd detkit
       python -m pip install .

.. warning::

    After the package is built and installed from the source code, the package cannot be imported properly if the current working directory is the same as the source code directory.
    To properly import the package, change the current working directory to a directory anywhere else **outside** of the source code directory. For instance:

    .. code-block:: python

        cd ..
        python
        >>> import detkit


==============================
Install in Virtual Environment
==============================

If you do not want the installation to occupy your main python's site-packages, you may install the package in an isolated virtual environment. Below we describe the installation procedure in two common virtual environments, namely, :ref:`virtualenv <virtualenv_env>` and :ref:`conda <conda_env>`.

.. _virtualenv_env:

-----------------------------------
Install in `virtualenv` Environment
-----------------------------------

1. Install `virtualenv`:

   ::

       python -m pip install virtualenv

2. Create a virtual environment and give it a name, such as ``detkit_env``

   ::

       python -m virtualenv detkit_env

3. Activate python in the new environment

   ::

       source detkit_env/bin/activate

4. Install `detkit` package with any of the :ref:`above methods <InstallationMethods>`. For instance:

   ::

       python -m pip install detkit
   
   Then, use the package in this environment.

5. To exit from the environment

   ::

       deactivate

.. _conda_env:

------------------------------
Install in `conda` Environment
------------------------------

In the following, it is assumed `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads>`_ (or `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_) is installed.

1. Initialize conda (if it was not initialized before)

   ::

       conda init

   You may need to close and reopen the terminal after the above command. Alternatively, instead of the above, you can do

   ::

       sudo sh $(conda info --root)/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

2. Create a virtual environment and give it a name, such as ``detkit_env``

   ::

       conda create --name detkit_env -y

   The command ``conda info --envs`` shows the list of all environments. The current environment is marked by an asterisk in the list, which should be the default environment at this stage. In the next step, we will change the current environment to the one we created.

3. Activate the new environment

   ::

       conda activate detkit_env

4. Install ``detkit`` with any of the :ref:`above methods <InstallationMethods>`. For instance:

   ::

       conda install -c s-ameli detkit
   
   Then, use the package in this environment.

5. To exit from the environment

   ::

       conda deactivate

======
Docker
======

|docker|

The `detkit` package can be run inside `detkit` docker image which is based on the Ubuntu 20.04 image.

**Download docker image**

::
    
    docker pull sameli/detkit

Installed programs on the docker image

* Python 3.9: `/usr/bin/python3`
* Python interpreters: `ipython`, `jupyter`
* Editor: `vim`

**Usage:**

* To run the container and open *python* interpreter directly at startup:

  ::
      
      docker run -it sameli/detkit

   This also imports `detkit` package automatically.

* To run the container and open *ipython* interpreter directly at startup:

  ::
      
      docker run -it sameli/detkit ipython

  This also imports `detkit` package automatically.

* To open a *bash shell* only:

  ::
      
      docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash sameli/detkit

* To *mount* the host directory `/home/user/project` on the docker's container directory `/root`, use:

  ::
      
      docker run -it -v /home/user/project:/root sameli/detkit

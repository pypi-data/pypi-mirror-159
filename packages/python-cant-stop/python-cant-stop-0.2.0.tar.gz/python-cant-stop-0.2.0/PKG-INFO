# Can't Stop strategy helper

Using the algorithm from [Solitaire Laboratory](http://www.solitairelaboratory.com/cantstop.html),
`cant-stop` tells you if you should stop or continue your current turn of the dice game
[Can't Stop](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41/cant-stop).

# Usage

`cant-stop` takes a list of strings of the format `<roll>x<count>` where `<roll>` is the roll column
and `<count>` is the number of tokens placed there this turn so far. For example, if you rolled a 1,
1, 2, and 3, and chose columns 2 and 5:

```bash
~$ cant-stop 2x1 5x1
INFO:cant_stop.cli:Your score is 18
```

and if you next rolled a 1, 1, 6, and 6:

```bash
~$ cant-stop 2x2 5x1 12x1
INFO:cant_stop.cli:Your score is 36
```

Time to stop!

"""
Paleos is a handy set of python utilities for paleoclimate/paleocean analysis.

The heavy lifting in paleos is done by the standard python scientific stack
including numpy, scipy and pandas. The main objective of paleos is to be a
simpler entry point for those who are coming from the domain first and are 
less experienced with programming.

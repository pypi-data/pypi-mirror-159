## Typing stubs for stdlib-list

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `stdlib-list` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `stdlib-list`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/stdlib-list. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `85077b273d15eb837cddc7e9ed5bcaf5661c2f3e`.

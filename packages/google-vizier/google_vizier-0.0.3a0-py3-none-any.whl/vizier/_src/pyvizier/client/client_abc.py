"""Cross-platform Vizier client interfaces.

Aside from "materialize_" methods, code written using these interfaces are
compatible with OSS and Cloud Vertex Vizier. Note importantly that subclasses
may have more methods than what is required by interfaces, and such methods
are not cross compatible. Our recommendation is to explicitly type your objects
to be `StudyInterface` or `TrialInterface` when you want to guarantee that
a code block is cross-platform.

Keywords:

#Materialize: The method returns a deep copy of the underlying pyvizier object.
Modifying the returned object does not update the Vizier service.

In this folder we collect few scripts to show how to run workchains.
Users should take these scripts as templates and adapt them to their own case.

All the scripts can be run through:

	runaiida script.py code@computer {stmcode@computer}

However, the user should make sure that the
computational resources selected in the script are compatible with their "computer"
(for instance "queue" and "account").

Indication about pseudo requirements to run the examples here are in ../00_README

The example example_neb_ghost.py requires the path to the lua scripts in the flos library.
Look at the docs for more info. Library can be found at https://github.com/siesta-project/flos

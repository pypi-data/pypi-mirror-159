Description: Introduction
        -------------
        
        ``pyRing`` is a python package for black hole (BH) ringdown analysis, model comparison and parameter estimation.
        The package is tailored for the analysis of the post-merger phase of Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) Gravitational-wave (GW) signals using a native time-domain likelihood formulation. It is integrated with standard LIGO-Virgo-Kagra software and supports:
        
        * Ringdown analyses of interferometric or simulated GW data using a variety of ringdown waveform models. All of them are analytical templates, some of them are calibrated to Numerical Relativity (NR).
        * Parametrised tests of General Relativity (GR), by adding parametrised deviations to the spectrum frequencies and damping times.
        * Quasi-normal modes (QNM) spectrum predictions for emissions alternative to the Kerr solution.
        
        The main usage features of the software have been internally reviewed for scientific usage from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration and the code is routinely used to produce catalogs of BH ringdown properties and tests of GR in the merger-ringdown regime by the LVK collaboration. 
        
        Tutorial slides are available `here <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1cNmga4kRvSJtdCZ5VuRCWrnja1vLtmQ6>`_, see also below for brief instructions on how to run a tutorial.
        
        **Disclaimer**: since the name ``pyring`` had already been taken on pypi (which is not case sensitive), the package has to be pip-installed with the name ``pyRingGW``. However, for all internal purposes and functionalities, the name of the package is ``pyRing``. For example, the help message can be accessed through ``pyRing --help``.

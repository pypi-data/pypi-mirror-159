## eis_download_files

## eis_browse_templates

A widget that allows you to select a file and see what fitting templates are available for that
file. First click on "Select a header file," navigate to the file you just downloaded, select it. A
good place to start is with a single component fit of Fe XII 195.119. Select that from the list and
click "Copy Template to Local Dir".

```
> eis_browse_templates
```

After running this you should have a new subdirectory `eis_template_dir` with the file
`fe_12_195_119.1c.template.h5` in it.

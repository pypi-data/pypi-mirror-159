`Mopidy <http://www.mopidy.com/>`_ extension that waits (up to around 5 minutes) for an internet connection during early phase of Mopidy startup (before other extensions start to initialize).


Installation
============

Install by running::

    pip install Mopidy-WaitForInternet


Configuration
=============

This extension has no configuration options in ``mopidy.conf`` apart from the default ``enabled`` setting::

    [waitforinternet]
    # To temporary disable this extension without uninstalling it
    enabled = false


Usage
=====

This extension will delay initialization of other Mopidy extensions until an internet connection has been initialized (for up to around 5 minutes).

Mopidy-WaitForInternet might be useful if other Mopidy extensions (e.g. extensions for online music streaming services) fail to initialize, because they try to connect to internet resources before machine running Mopidy has established an internet connection (e.g. connected to wifi).

Important internals
===================

Mopidy-WaitForInternet uses several different URLs (currently - requests to public `DoH <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS>`_ servers) to check internet connectivity. As a future-proofing measure there is a `weekly servers-test build <https://github.com/DavisNT/mopidy-waitforinternet/actions/workflows/servers-test.yml>`_ that verifies availability of these URLs.

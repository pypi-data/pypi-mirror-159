A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
A penny for your thoughts.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
A picture is worth 1000 words.
Actions speak louder than words.
Barking up the wrong tree.
Birds of a feather flock together.
By the skin of your teeth.
Comparing apples to oranges.
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Don't cry over spilt milk.
Don't give up your day job.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Get a taste of your own medicine.
Good things come to those who wait.
He has bigger fish to fry.
He's a chip off the old block.
Hit the nail on the head.
It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
It takes one to know one.
It's raining cats and dogs.
Kill two birds with one stone.
Let the cat out of the bag.
Look before you leap.
Saving for a rainy day.
Slow and steady wins the race.
Take it with a grain of salt.
The ball is in your court.
The best thing since sliced bread.
The devil is in the details.
The early bird gets the worm.
The elephant in the room.
The whole nine yards.
There are other fish in the sea.
There's a method to his madness.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
Throw caution to the wind.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
A little learning is a dangerous thing.
A snowball's chance in hell.
A stitch in time saves nine.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Bolt from the blue.
Calm before the storm.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Don't beat a dead horse.
Every dog has his day.
Familiarity breeds contempt.
Fortune favours the bold.
Haste makes waste.
He who laughs last laughs loudest.
He's not playing with a full deck.
He's sitting on the fence.
It is a poor workman who blames his tools.
It is always darkest before the dawn.
It takes two to tango.
Know which way the wind is blowing.
Leave no stone unturned.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Like riding a bicycle.
Like two peas in a pod.
Make hay while the sun shines.
Once bitten, twice shy.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
Shape up or ship out.
The pot calling the kettle black.
There are clouds on the horizon.
Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
Through thick and thin.
Waste not, want not.
Well begun is half done.
When it rains it pours.
You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs.

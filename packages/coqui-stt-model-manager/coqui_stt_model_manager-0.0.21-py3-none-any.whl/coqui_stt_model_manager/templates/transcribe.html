This {{ model_card.language }} model is specialized to recognize digits (i.e. from "zero" to "nine" in {{ model_card.language }}) and the words for "yes" and "no" (if they exist in {{ model_card.language }}). This model will only predict these words.
Specializing a model's vocabulary is commonly used in conversational STT. If you'd like to specialize this {{ model_card.language }} model to another set of words, it's as easy as <a href="https://stt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/LANGUAGE_MODEL.html">swapping out the language model</a>.

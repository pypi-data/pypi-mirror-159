def fold(self, period=None, t0=None, event="Mid-Transit"):
    """
    Fold this Rainbow to a period and reference epoch.

    Parameters
    ----------
    period : u.Quantity
        The orbital period of the planet (with astropy units of time).
    t0 : u.Quantity
        Any mid-transit epoch (with astropy units of time).
    event : str
        A description of the event that happens periodically.
        For example, you might want to switch this to
        'Mid-Eclipse' (as well as offsetting the `t0` by the
        appropriate amount relative to transit). This description
        may be used in plot labels.

    Returns
    -------
    folded : Rainbow
        The folded Rainbow

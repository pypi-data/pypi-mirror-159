WIP

<!-- It is split into the following sections:

 - **General utilities** for stuff like functional programming, utility functions, parallel jobs, caching to a file, etc. Wraps `joblib`. Found in the default namespace (`*`)
  - **Web-related utilities** wrapping web scraping with Beautiful Soup and requests or browser automation with Selenium. Found in the `web` namespace
  - **Logging** Logging made super easy. Found in the `log` namespace

Currently, only the web-related utilities are implemented

## FAQ

### Why the name?

This library's name was taken from the 18**49** gold rush. In the modern world, data is gold. -->

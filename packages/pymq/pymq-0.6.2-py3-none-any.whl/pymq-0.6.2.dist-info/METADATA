PyMQ is a simple message-oriented middleware library for implementing Python IPC across machine boundaries. The API
enables different styles of remoting via Pub/Sub, Queues, and synchronous RPC.

With PyMQ, developers can integrate Python applications running on different machines in a loosely coupled way over
existing transport mechanisms.
PyMQ currently provides
a Redis backend,
an AWS backend using SQS and SNS,
a POSIX IPC backend for single-machine IPC, and
an in-memory backend for testing.
The API is extensible and other transports can be plugged in.

Using PyMQ
----------

### Install

Starting from pymq 0.5, all providers are separated into setuptools extras.
If you want to use the redis backend, then run

    pip install pymq[redis]

Available providers:

* `pymq[redis]` Redis provider
* `pymq[aws]` AWS provider using SNS and SQS
* `pymq[ipc]` Linux IPC provider
* `pymq[full]` install all providers

### Initialize PyMQ

The core module manages a global eventbus instance that provides the remoting primitives. The default Redis
implementation uses an event loop over a pubsub object. The global eventbus is initialized via `pymq.init` and by
passing a provider factory.

```python
import pymq
from pymq.provider.redis import RedisConfig

# starts a new thread with a Redis event loop
pymq.init(RedisConfig())

# main application control loop

pymq.shutdown()
```
This will create an eventbus instance on top of a local Redis server.

### Pub/Sub

Pub/Sub allows asynchronous event-based communication. Event classes are used to transport state and identify channels.

```python
import pymq

# common code
class MyEvent:
    pass

# subscribe code
@pymq.subscriber
def on_event(event: MyEvent):
    print('event received')

# publisher code
pymq.publish(MyEvent())
```

### Queues

Queues are straight forward, as they are compatible to the Python `queue.Queue` specification.

```python
import pymq

queue = pymq.queue('my_queue') 
queue.put('obj')
print(queue.get()) # outputs 'obj'
```

### RPC

Server code

```python
import pymq

@pymq.remote('product_remote')
def product(a: int, b: int) -> int: # pymq relies on type hints for marshalling
    return a * b
```

Client code
```python
import pymq

product = pymq.stub('product_remote')
product(2, 4) # 8
```

With a shared code-base, methods can also be exposed and called by passing the callable. For example,
```python
import pymq

# common code
class Remote:
    def echo(self, param) -> None:
        return 'echo: ' + param

# server
obj = Remote()
pymq.expose(obj.echo)

# client
echo = pymq.stub(Remote.echo)
echo('pymq') # "echo: pymq"
```

If there are multiple providers of the same object, then a stub can be initialized with `multi=True` to get a list of
results. It may be useful to use a timeout in this case.

```python
remote = pymq.stub('remote_method', multi=True, timeout=2)

result = remote() # result will be a list containing the results of all invocations of available remote objects
```

Providers
---------

* `SimpleEventBus` used for testing and rudimentary single-thread dispatching
* `RedisEventBus` works across network and process boundaries but requires a running redis instance
* `AwsEventBus` uses AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Simple Queuing Service (SQS)
* `IpcEventBus` uses `posix_ipc` message queues as event loops and maintains a tree of topic subscriptions in
  `/run/shm`. Useful for eventing across process boundaries without an additional server component.

Compatibility
-------------

Python 3.8+

Known Limitations
-----------------

* JSON serialization relies heavily on type hints. Sending complex types without type hints will cause type errors.
* There is currently no support for polymorphism with JSON serialization
* Pattern-based topic matching does not work for the in-memory eventbus or the IPC event bus
* You can only have a limited number of Queues when using the IPC provider, as the kernel limits the number of file
  descriptors per process
* Subscriptions by foreign components to RPC channels will cause issues in multi-call scenarios
* Using the `pymq` singleton in multiprocessing scenarios may not work as expected because the module holds a Thread in
  a global variable. A workaround is to re-start the bus by calling `shutdown()` and `init()` in the forked Process.
* IPC provider only works for Linux
* Multi-RPC does not work for the AWS provider
* AWS provider cannot automatically delete all queues and topics.

Background

Originally part of the [Symmetry](https://dsg.tuwien.ac.at/team/trausch/pub/sec19-demo-trausch.pdf) project, was extracted as a standalone
library.

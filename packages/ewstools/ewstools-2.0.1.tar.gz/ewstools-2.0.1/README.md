# ewstools
**A Python package for early warning signals (EWS) of bifurcations in time series data.**

## Overview

Many systems across nature and society have the capacity to undergo an abrupt and profound change in their dynamics. From a dynamical systemes perspective, these changes corresopond to bifurcations, which carry some generic features that can be picked up on in time series data ([Scheffer et al. 2009](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08227)). Two commonly used metrics include variance and lag-1 autocorrelation, though there exist many others (see e.g. [Clements & Ozgul 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.12948)). More recently, deep learning methods have been developed to provide early warning signals, whilst also signalling the type of bifurcation approaching [(Bury et al. 2021)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2106140118).

The goal of this Python package is to provide a user-friendly toolbox for computing early warning signals in time series data. It complements an existing early warning signals package in R ([Dakos et al. 2012](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0041010)). We hope that having an early warning signal toolbox in Python will allow for additional testing, and appeal to those who primarily work in Python. I will try to keep it updated with the latest methods.

Current functionality of *ewstools* includes

  - Time series detrending methods using
    - A Gaussian kernel
    - LOWESS (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing)

  - Computation of CSD-based early warning signals including:
    - Variance and associated metrics (standard deviation, coefficient of variation)
    - Autocorrelation (at specified lag times)
    - Higher-order statistical moments (skewness, kurtosis)
    - Power spectrum and associated metrics

  - Computation of Kendall tau values to quantify trends
  
  - Application of deep learning classifiers for bifurcation prediction as in [Bury et al. (2022) PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2106140118).

  - Block-bootstrapping of time-series to obtain confidence intervals on EWS estimates
  
  - Visualisation tools to display output

*ewstools* makes use of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for dataframe handling, [numpy](https://numpy.org/) for fast numerical computing, [plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/) for visuliastion, [lmfit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/) for least-squares minimisation, [arch](https://github.com/bashtage/arch) for bootstrapping methods, [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) and [scipy](https://scipy.org/) for detrending methods, and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) for deep learning.


## Install

Requires Python 3.7 or later. You can install *ewstools* with pip using the commands

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ewstools
```

[Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) is required for the tutorials, and can be installed with the command
```bash
pip install jupyter notebook
```
Package dependencies of *ewstools* are
```bash
'pandas>=1.2.0',
'numpy>=1.20.0',
'plotly>=5.3.0',
'lmfit>=0.9', 
'arch>=4.7',
'statsmodels>=0.12.0',
'scipy>=1.5.0',
```
and should be installed automatically. To use any of the deep learning functionality, you will need to install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) v2.0.0 or later.

To install the latest *development* version of *ewstools*, use the command
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/thomasmbury/ewstools.git#egg=ewstools
```
NB: the development version comes with the risk of undergoing continual changes, and has not undergone the level of scrutiny of official releases.

## Quick demo

First we need to import *ewstools* and collect the data we wish to analyse. Here we will run a simulation of the Ricker model, one of the model functions stored in [`ewstools.models`](https://ewstools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ewstools.html#ewstools-models-submodule).
```python
import ewstools
from ewstools.models import simulate_ricker
series = simulate_ricker(tmax=500, F=[0,2.7])
series.plot();
```
![](tutorials/images/series.png)

We then make a [`TimeSeries`](https://ewstools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ewstools.html#ewstools.core.TimeSeries) object, which takes in our data and a transition time (if desired). EWS are not computed beyond the transition time.

```python
ts = ewstools.TimeSeries(data=series, transition=440)
```

We can then detrend, compute EWS and calculate Kendall tau statistics by applying methods to the [`TimeSeries`](https://ewstools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ewstools.html#ewstools.core.TimeSeries) object:

```python
ts.detrend(method='Lowess', span=0.2)
ts.compute_var(rolling_window=0.5)
ts.compute_auto(lag=1, rolling_window=0.5)
ts.compute_auto(lag=2, rolling_window=0.5)
ts.compute_ktau()
```

Finally, we can view output as an interactive [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) figure (when run in a Jupyter notebook) using

```python
ts.make_plotly()
```

More detailed demonstrations can be found in the tutorials, and all methods are listed in the documentation.

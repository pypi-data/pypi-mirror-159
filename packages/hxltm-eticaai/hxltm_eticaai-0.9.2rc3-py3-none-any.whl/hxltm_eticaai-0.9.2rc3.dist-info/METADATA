The _Multilingual Terminology in Humanitarian Language Exchange_
(abbreviation: _HXLTM_) is an HXLated valid tabular format (stricly, a
documented subset of [HXL Standard](https://hxlstandard.org/[HXL]) started by
[HXL-CPLP](https://github.com/HXL-CPLP)) with strong focus to store community
contributed translations and multilingual terminology while maximizing
portability for implementers.

**The documentation is available at <https://hxltm.etica.ai/>.**

```bash
pip install hxltm-eticaai --upgrade
```

## Creative content license (algorithms and concepts as pivot exchange for other data standards, and user documentation)

[![Public Domain](https://i.creativecommons.org/p/zero/1.0/88x31.png)](UNLICENSE)

To the extent possible under law, [Etica.AI](https://github.com/EticaAI)

<summary>More context about this</summary>

This different license for creative content is mostly for lawyers who would
complain about use of Unlicense for creative content. More context (from the
point of open source) on waiving patent rigths explicitly (since no better license for
creative content do exist) is here: <https://opensource.org/faq#cc-zero>.

There is no interest by ourselves to do _patent troll_ (for monetary gain)
or allow abuse copyrights (to enforce companies, organizations, o
governments) even if:

- we directly strongly disagree
- some entity try to use us as proxy to enforce us some sort of boycott to any
  other entity.

Note that data exchange on humanitarian context, even outside global-like
war-time, already is quite complex and the need of accurate linguistic content
conversion still even more critical to not have know errors. While the idea of
stories behind cases like the "_黙殺_" ("_mokusatsu_") are disputable, the
modern tooling to deal with multilingual terminology (including used to
create dictionaries) is prone to human error.

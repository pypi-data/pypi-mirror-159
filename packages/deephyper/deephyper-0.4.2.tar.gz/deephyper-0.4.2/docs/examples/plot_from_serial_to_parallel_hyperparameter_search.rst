From Serial to Parallel Evaluations
===================================

**Author(s)**: Romain Egele.

This example demonstrates the advantages of parallel evaluations over serial evaluations. We start by defining an artificial black-box ``run``-function by using the Ackley function:

.. image:: https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/ackley.png
  :width: 400
  :alt: Ackley Function in 2D

We will use the ``time.sleep`` function to simulate a budget of 2 secondes of execution in average which helps illustrate the advantage of parallel evaluations. The ``@profile`` decorator is useful to collect starting/ending time of the ``run``-function execution which help us know exactly when we are inside the black-box. When using this decorator, the ``run``-function will return a dictionnary with 2 new keys ``"timestamp_start"`` and ``"timestamp_end"``. The ``run``-function is defined in a separate module because of the "multiprocessing" backend that we are using in this example.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/black_box_util.py
   :language: python

After defining the black-box we can continue with the definition of our main script:

    import black_box_util as black_box









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-26

Then we define the variable(s) we want to optimize. For this problem we optimize Ackley in a 2-dimensional search space, the true minimul is located at ``(0, 0)``.

Then we define serial search by creation a ``"serial"``-evaluator and we execute the search with a fixed time-budget of 2 minutes (i.e., 120 secondes).

After, executing the serial-search for 2 minutes we can create a parallel search which uses the ``"process"``-evaluator and defines 5 parallel workers. The search is also executed for 2 minutes.

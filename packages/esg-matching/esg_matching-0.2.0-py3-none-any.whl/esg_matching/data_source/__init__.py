""" This package provides two modules to represent data sources linked to tables in a database:
1. db_match: data source for the matching and no-matching tables in a database.
2. db_source: data source for the data to be matched (targets or reference tables)

A data source class describes the structure of a table in a database, as well as, how the attributes can be used in
a matching scenario.

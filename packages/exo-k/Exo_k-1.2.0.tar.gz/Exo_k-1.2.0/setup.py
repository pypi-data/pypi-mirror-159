    'long_description': "# Exo_k\n\nAuthor: Jeremy Leconte (CNRS/LAB/Univ. Bordeaux)\n\n`Exo_k` is a Python 3 based library to handle radiative opacities from various sources for atmospheric applications.\nIt enables you to:\n\n* Interpolate efficiently and easily in correlated-k and cross section tables.\n* Convert easily correlated-k and cross section tables from one format to another\n  (hdf5, LMDZ GCM, Exomol, Nemesis, PetitCode, TauREx, ExoREM, ARCIS, etc.).\n* Adapt precomputed correlated-k tables to your needs by changing:\n\n  * the resolution and quadrature (g) grid,\n  * the pressure/temperature grid.\n* Create tables for a mix of gases using tables for individual gases.\n* Create your own tables from high-resolution spectra (for example from K-spectrum, Helios-K, etc.).\n* Use your data in an integrated radiative transfer framework to simulate planetary atmospheres.\n  \nFor a complete online documentation, checkout:\nhttp://perso.astrophy.u-bordeaux.fr/~jleconte/exo_k-doc/index.html\n\nIn this repository, you'll find a [tutorial jupyter notebook](https://forge.oasu.u-bordeaux.fr/jleconte/exo_k-public/-/blob/public/tutorial-exo_k.ipynb) that will show you how to do all that\nwith concrete examples that you can run on your own machine. Many important concepts and options are\npresented along the way.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nJ. Leconte\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nIf you use this library in your research, please acknowledge it by citing\n[Leconte (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...645A..20L/abstract):\n\n  * Spectral binning of precomputed correlated-k coefficients. **Astronomy and Astrophysics** 645.

In particular, we can test several python versions. Additional tests should rapidly come along.\nRosseland and Planck mean opacities can now be computed from radiative tables. \n\n# Installation\n\nExo_k can be installed using pip (without cloning the repository;\ndependencies should be downloaded automatically):\n```\npip install exo_k\n```\nOr by running the [setup.py](https://forge.oasu.u-bordeaux.fr/jleconte/exo_k-public/-/blob/public/setup.py) script in the cloned repository:\n```\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nTo learn how to use `exo_k`, you can follow the [tutorial jupyter notebook](https://forge.oasu.u-bordeaux.fr/jleconte/exo_k-public/-/blob/public/tutorial-exo_k.ipynb).\n\nHave fun!\n\n# Links\n\n* Project homepage: http://perso.astrophy.u-bordeaux.fr/~jleconte/\n* Code repository: https://forge.oasu.u-bordeaux.fr/jleconte/exo_k-public\n* Documentation: http://perso.astrophy.u-bordeaux.fr/~jleconte/exo_k-doc/index.html\n* Contact: jeremy.leconte at u-bordeaux.fr\n\n\n# past releases\n\nv1.1.0 (August 2021): New scheme for the computation of atmospheric emission/transmission\nto ensure an improved numerical accuracy. The variable names to instantiate atm objects have\nchanged accordingly (see tutorial). \n\nv1.0.2 (June 2021): Adds a few missing dependencies. Enables computation of thermal\nemission spectra with scattering through the two-stream method (full documentation pending). \nEnables creating Xtables for a mix of gases (CIA can be added as well). Solves some issues\nwith the 2018 Hitran CIA format.\n\nv1.0.1 (Jan 2021): Solves a binary/string conversion issue introduced by version 3 of h5py.\nEnables linear interpolation in pressure (default is log). Enables creation of\nempty tables to be filled later and extension of the spectral range of existing tables. \n\nv1.0.0 (Dec 2020): Finally our first official version. Creation of a\n'examples' notebook with fully worked out use cases for the `Exo_k`. \n\nv0.0.5 (Oct 2020): Ensures compatibility with latest Exomol correlated-k and cross-section tables.",

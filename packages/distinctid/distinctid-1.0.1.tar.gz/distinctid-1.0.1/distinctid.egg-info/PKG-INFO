# DISTINCTID
With `distinctid`, you can generate distinct/unique IDs. Just think of it as something that can replace your UUID. It has the advantage of being a long integer and can be sorted in ASC or DESC order.

# Philosophy
This code is pure Python and relies on [this article](https://instagram-engineering.com/sharding-ids-at-instagram-1cf5a71e5a5c) which led to [this](https://gist.github.com/ichux/1b5d15129370341811fb12eb7e333917), [this](https://github.com/ichux/postgresql-id-shard) and this present project you are reading now.

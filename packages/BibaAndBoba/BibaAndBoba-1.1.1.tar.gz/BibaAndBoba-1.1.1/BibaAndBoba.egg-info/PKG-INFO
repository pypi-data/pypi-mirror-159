## BibaAndBoba
Python package for analyzing Telegram chats and finding correlations between people

## About

**BibaAndBoba** is a tool for analyzing files containing Telegram chat
history.

It will allow you to identify the so-called parasite words for each
person you are talking to, and will also allow you to find the
correlation coefficient between your two interlocutors. Such a
coefficient represents the probability that these two people communicate
with each other. 
> This approach is based on the fact that people tend to
adopt the words used by the interlocutor.

## Usage

### Installation

First you have to install the BibaAndBoba package using pip

``` shell
$ pip install BibaAndBoba
```

You can also install `BibaAndBoba` from source, though this is usually not necessary

``` shell
$ git clone https://github.com/andylvua/BibaAndBoba.git
$ cd BibaAndBoba
$ python setup.py install
```

### Preparing Telegram chat history files

#### How to choose chats

Analysis requires at least 2 chats. One chat will be used as the base
and the other will be used as an auxiliary to identify words that are
unique to your interlocutor.

> **Note**
> 
> For a correct analysis, the auxiliary chat should be selected in such a
way that this person communicates as little as possible with the one you
want to analyze.

It takes at least 3 chats, *preferably 4*, to find the correlation
coefficient between two people. 2 of them are with people, the
correlation between which you want to find. 2 auxiliary chats will also
be required, chosen according to the principle described above. 

> If you know a person who does not communicate with any of the ones you want to
analyze, you can use the chat with them for both base chats. However,
remember that such approach will still reduce the accuracy of the
analysis, so choose a different support chat for each individual if
possible.

#### Exporting chat history files

1.  **Navigate to the chat you want to analyze.**

Find the three dots menu, and select the `Export chat history` option:

2.  **Configure chat export settings as shown below.**

-   Disable the `Photos` option.
-   Set `Size limit` to 500 MB.

-   Set `Format` to `Machine-readable JSON`.
-   Set `Path` to your desired export directory.

**Click** `Export` and wait for the export to finish.

**The file that will be used for analysis will be located in the path
you selected under the name** `result.json`

> I recommend to immediately rename the source files to the name of your
> interlocutor for your convenience. For example, if you export a chat
> with *Pavlo*, rename the file `result.json` to `pavlo.json`.

Now we are ready to go.

## Code

### Finding parasite words

Assuming you have the following project structure:

<img src="BibaAndBoba/docs/assets/project-structure.png" width="300">

For example, you want to find words that `Pavlo` uses often. At the same
time, you know that the `Roma` hardly or not at all communicate with him - see [How to choose chats](#how-to-choose-chats).

BibaAndBoba uses the [`BibaAndBoba`](https://github.com/andylvua/BibaAndBoba/blob/1d7b883e1ddb722002623bfdf266553902ad2145/BibaAndBoba/biba_and_boba.py)
class to analyze chat history files.

``` python
from BibaAndBoba import BibaAndBoba


def main():
    pavlo = BibaAndBoba("resources/pavlo.json", "resources/roma.json")

    print(pavlo.freq_dist())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Finding the correlation coefficient

It's pretty easy to do.

Create 2 objects for the people you want to find the correlation between
and pass them to the
`Comparator` class using the `get_correlation()` method.

``` python
from BibaAndBoba import BibaAndBoba, Comparator


def main():
    pavlo = BibaAndBoba("resources/pavlo.json", "resources/roma.json")
    andrii = BibaAndBoba("resources/andrii.json", "resources/nasta.json")

    correlation = Comparator(pavlo, andrii).get_correlation()
    print(correlation)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

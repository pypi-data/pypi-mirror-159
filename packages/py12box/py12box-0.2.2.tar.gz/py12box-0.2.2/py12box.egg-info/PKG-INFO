# AGAGE 12-box model

This is a Python version of the AGAGE 12-box model described (first as a 9-box model) in Cunnold et al., 1983. Subsequently modified in Cunnold et al., 1994 and Rigby et al., 2013. This version is based on the IDL version from Rigby et al., 2013. 

This code started as a python 3 port by Eunchong Chung of the IDL code written by Matt Rigby available from: https://bitbucket.org/mrghg/agage-12-box-model/. It was subsequently modified by Matt Rigby.

## Installation

This code can be installed using conda or pip:

```conda install -c mrghg py12box```

or:

```pip install py12box```

## Getting started

Please read the documentation [here](https://py12box.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Also see examples of usage in [this repository](https://github.com/mrghg/py12box) under the "notebooks" folder.

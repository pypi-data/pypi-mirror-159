.SH ARGOS EXAMPLES

These examples assumes a project named \fBfordyca\fP which contains a controller
defined in the \fBcontrollers.yaml\fP as \fBd0.CRW\fP, with a runtime environment of
the local machine.

This will run a batch of 7 experiments using a correlated random walk robot
controller (CRW), across which the swarm size will be varied from 1..64, by
powers of 2. Within each experiment, 3 copies of each simulation will be run
(each with different random seeds), for a total of 21 ARGoS simulations. On a
reasonable machine it should take about 10 minutes or so to run. After it
finishes, you can go to \fB$HOME/exp\fP and find all the simulation outputs. For
an explanation of SIERRA\(aqs runtime directory tree, see
ln\-sierra\-usage\-runtime\-exp\-tree\&.
.SS Rendering Example

This example shows how to use ARGoS image capturing ability to create nice
videos of simulations.

The runs 3 simulations in parallel with 1 physics engine each, and runs ARGoS
under \fBXvfb\fP to get it to render headless images. During stage 4, these
images are stitched together using \fBffmpeg\fP to create videos (see
ln\-sierra\-usage\-runtime\-exp\-tree for where the videos will appear). No graphs
are generated during stage 4 in this example.
.sp
You may also be interested in the \fB\-\-camera\-config\fP option, which allows you
to specify different static/dynamic camera arrangements (e.g., do a nice
circular pan around the arena during simulation).
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Because LOTS of images can be captured by ARGoS to create videos,
depending on simulation length, you usually want to have a very small
\fB\-\-n\-runs\fP to avoid filling up the filesystem.

.SS Stage 5 Example
.sp
This example assumes that stages 1\-4 have been run successfully with a project
named \fBfordyca\fP and that a univariate batch criteria has been used (such as

This will compare all scenarios that all controllers with \fB$HOME/exp\fP which
have been run on the same set of scenarios according to the configuration
defined in \fBstage5.yaml\fP\&. It will plot the 95% confidence intervals on all
generated graphs for the univariate batch criteria.

This will run a batch of 4 experiments using a correlated random walk controller
(CRW) on the turtlebot3. Population size will be varied from 1..8, by powers
of 2. Within each experiment, 4 copies of each simulation will be run (each with
different random seeds), for a total of 16 Gazebo simulations. On a reasonable
machine it should take about 10 minutes or so to run. After it finishes, you can
go to \fB$HOME/exp\fP and find all the simulation outputs. For an explanation of

This will run a batch of 4 experiments using a correlated random walk controller
(CRW) on the turtlebot3. Population size will be varied from 1,2,3,4,5,6. Within
each experiment, 4 experimental runs will be conducted with each swarm
size. SIERRA will pause for 60 seconds between runs so you can reset the robot\(aqs
positions and environment before continuing with the next
run. \fBturtlebots3.txt\fP contains the IP addresses of all 6 robots in the swarm
(SIERRA may use different combinations of these if the swarm size is < 6). For
these experiments, no master node is needed, so it is disabled. After all runs
have completed and SIERRA finishes stages 3 and 4, you can go to \fB$HOME/exp\fP
and find all the simulation outputs. For an explanation of SIERRA\(aqs runtime
directory tree, see ln\-sierra\-usage\-runtime\-exp\-tree\&.

This project is intended to be used by [Pyut Plugin](https://github.com/hasii2011/pyutplugincore) developers to convert [Pyut](https://github.com/hasii2011/PyUt) XML files to the [Ogl Model](https://github.com/hasii2011/ogl) classes.  These model classes can then be used by the Pyut UI to display as UML Diagrams.

------

Use as follows:

```python
from untanglepyut.UnTangler import Document
from untanglepyut.UnTangler import UnTangler
from untanglepyut.UnTangler import UntangledOglClasses
from untanglepyut.UnTangler import UntangledOglLinks

untangler: UnTangler = UnTangler(fqFileName='MultiDocumentProject.xml')


document:   Document            = untangler.documents['Diagram-1']
oglClasses: UntangledOglClasses = document.oglClasses
oglLinks:   UntangledOglLinks   = document.oglLinks

```



The following is the UML diagram for the Pyut Untangler

I am concerned about GitHub's Copilot project



I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org).

While I do not advocate for all the issues listed there I do not like that
a company like Microsoft may profit from open source projects.

I continue to use GitHub because it offers the services I need for free.  But, I continue
to monitor their terms of service.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without my permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.

A repository owner may opt out of Copilot by changing Settings --> GitHub Copilot.

I have done so.

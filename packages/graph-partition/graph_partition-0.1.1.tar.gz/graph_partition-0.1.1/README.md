# Graph Partitioning
Graph Partitioning is an age-old problem with applications in various domains, such as 
routing vehicles for delivery and finding the right target for immunizations to control a 
pandemic. Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) employ deep learning techniques to solve the 
problem of graph partitioning.

# Installation
You can install the graph-partition from PyPI:
```shell

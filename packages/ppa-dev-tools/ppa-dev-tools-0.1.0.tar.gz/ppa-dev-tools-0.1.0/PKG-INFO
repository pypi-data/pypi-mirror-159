Description: # Ppa Dev Tools #
        
        ppa is a command line client for managing PPAs in Launchpad.
        
        This primarily focuses on functionality needed by owners of PPAs, to
        assist in their creation, deletion, and configuration.  A key
        functionality is to poll and wait until the package(s) in the PPA have
        completed building; this permits blocking on the builds to delay other
        actions such as requesting users on a bug report to test the PPA, or
        submitting a merge proposal for the update to be considered for
        inclusion in the distro.
        
        You can view a team's registered PPAs using 'ppa list'.
        
        
        ## Usage ##
        
        Register a new PPA
        $ ppa create my-ppa
        PPA 'my-ppa' created for the following architectures:
        
          i386, amd64, armel, armhf, ppc64el, s390x, arm64, powerpc
        
        The PPA can be viewed at:
        
          https://launchpad.net/~my-name/+archive/ubuntu/my-ppa
        
        You can upload packages to this PPA using:
        
          dput ppa:my-name/my-ppa <source.changes>
        
        Upload a package to the PPA
        $ dput ppa:my-name/my-ppa some-package.changes
        
        Wait until all packages in the PPA have finished building
        $ ppa wait my-ppa
        
        Set the public description for a PPA from a file
        $ cat some-package/README | ppa desc ppa:my-name/my-ppa
        
        Delete the PPA
        $ ppa destroy my-ppa

# Ppa Dev Tools #

ppa is a command line client for managing PPAs in Launchpad.

This primarily focuses on functionality needed by owners of PPAs, to
assist in their creation, deletion, and configuration.  A key
functionality is to poll and wait until the package(s) in the PPA have
completed building; this permits blocking on the builds to delay other
actions such as requesting users on a bug report to test the PPA, or
submitting a merge proposal for the update to be considered for
inclusion in the distro.

You can view a team's registered PPAs using 'ppa list'.


## Usage ##

$ ppa create my-ppa

The PPA can be viewed at:

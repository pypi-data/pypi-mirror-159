    "`multiple-inference`'s truncated normal distribution has two advantages over scipy's. First, it uses the state-of-the-art [exponential tilting](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7408180) method which improves performance in the tails. Second, it allows for concave truncation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we plot the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a standard normal truncated to the interval $(8, \\infty)$. As we can see, scipy's CDF evaluated at 9 is greater than 1. Clearly, this cannot be correct, because a CDF cannot exceed 1 [by definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function). By contrast, multiple inference's truncated normal CDF does not exceed 1."

    "# Inference after ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a template for regression analysis after ranking. It estimates the parameters using conditionally quantile-unbiased estimates and \"almost\" quantile-unbiased hybrid estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the badge below to use this template on your own data. This will open the notebook in a Jupyter binder.\n",

    "[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/dsbowen%2Fconditional-inference/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/docs/examples/rank_conditions.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upload a file named `data.csv` to this folder with your conventional estimates. Open `data.csv` to see an example. In this file, we named our dependent variable \"dep_variable\", and have estimated parameters named \"policy0\",..., \"policy9\". The first column of `data.csv` contains the conventional estimates $m$ of the unknown parameters. The remaining columns contain consistent estimates of the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. In `data.csv`, $m=(0, 1,..., 9)$ and $\\Sigma = I$.\n",
    "2. Modify the code if necessary.\n",
    "3. Run the notebook.\n",

    "If you are estimating the effects of many policies or the policy effects are close together, you may see `RuntimeWarning` messages and experience long runtimes. Runtime warnings are common, usually benign, and can be safely ignored."

    "One property we want our estimators to have is *quantile-unbiasedness*. An estimator is quantile-unbiased if the true parameter falls below its $\\alpha$-quantile estimate with probability $\\alpha$ given its estimated rank. For example, the true effect of the top-performing treatment should fall below its median estimate half the time.\n",

    "Conditional inference is a strict requirement. Conditionally quantile-unbiased estimates can be highly variable. And conditionally correct confidence intervals can be unrealistically long.

We need *conditional* inference if we're interested the subset of trials where a specific parameter $k$ was the top performer.

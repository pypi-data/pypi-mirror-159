The authors partnered with Penn Medicine to send patients one of 19 text messages encouraging them to get a flu vaccine. Using OLS, the authors reported their average text message increased vaccination rates by 2.1 people per hundred compared to the control group. The top-performing message was twice as effective, increasing vaccination rates by a stunning [4.6 people per hundred](https://twitter.com/katy_milkman/status/1362579547401687040).\n",

    "## How does Bayesian analysis work?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bayesian analysis, we start with a prior belief. For example, we might expect that each of the treatments we're about to test will increase vaccination rates by 4 percentage points relative to the control condition. Then we collect data and update our belief. [Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) is a mathematical formula that tells us how much we should update our prior belief based on the data. The updated belief is called a *posterior*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do we get our prior belief?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical Bayes takes the prior as a given. For example, you might have a prior belief based on data from previous studies or a survey of subject matter experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can often obtain better estimates by using empirical Bayes to estimate the prior from the data. Estimating the prior using data might sound like a contradiction. By definition, the prior is what you expect *before* seeing any data, so doesn't estimating the prior using data undermine what we're trying to do here?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how [empirical Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method) estimates the prior, imagine predicting MLB players' on-base percentage (OBP) next season. We might predict that a player's OBP next season will be the same as his OBP in the previous season. But how can we predict the OBP for a rookie with no batting history? One solution is to predict that the rookie's OBP will be similar to last season's rookies' OBP. In Bayesian terms, we've constructed a prior belief about *next* season's rookies' OBP using data from the *previous* season's rookies' rookies' OBP.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply the same logic to the flu study. Imagine we randomly select one text message and put the data for that treatment in a locked box. What should our prior belief about the effect of this text message be? Empirical Bayes says that our prior belief about the effect of the message we locked in the box should be the average effect of the other 18. We can also use the variability in the effects of the other 18 messages to tell us how confident we should be in our prior, giving us a *prior distribution*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical Bayes estimators can be parametric or non-parametric. Parametric empirical Bayes assumes the shape of the prior distribution. Nonparametric empirical Bayes does not assume the shape of the prior distribution.\n",

    "## Why should I use Bayesian analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use this fancy, complicated Bayesian analysis when you can use standard techniques like OLS? The short answer is that Bayesian estimators make better predictions of the true treatment effects than OLS. We can verify that Bayesian estimators are better using mathematical proofs, out-of-sample testing, and reconstruction plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's look at the math. James and Stein (1961) proved that their empirical Bayes estimator *dominates* unbiased estimators like OLS. This means that the James-Stein estimator has a lower expected mean squared error than OLS, regardless of the true treatment effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, unbiased estimators like OLS exaggerate the variability of treatment effects. This fictitious variation makes it seem like treatment effects vary widely even if they do not. [Bayesian estimates \"shrink\" OLS estimates](https://kiwidamien.github.io/shrinkage-and-empirical-bayes-to-improve-inference.html), meaning that the posterior belief always falls between the OLS estimate and the prior. Bayesian estimators reduce and often eliminate fictitious variation by shrinking the OLS estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second way to verify that Bayesian estimators make better predictions than OLS is to use [out-of-sample testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)). To understand out-of-sample testing, imagine we decide to run our experiment twice. After the first experiment, we get both Bayesian and OLS estimates. Then, we use these estimates to predict what will happen in the second experiment. After running the second experiment, we can see which estimator was better.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may not be able to rerun our experiment, but we can simulate this process by splitting our data in half. We'll use one half of the data (the *training set* or *in-sample data*) to train our models and get Bayesian and OLS estimates. Then, we test how well these estimates matched the other half of the data (the *test set* or *out-of-sample data*).\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we tell how well our estimates \"matched\" the test set? We'll measure the mean squared error between the estimated effects on the training set to the OLS treatment effect estimates on the test set. The estimator with the lowest mean squared error is the best.\n",

Beyond the mere act of texting a reminder, there's no evidence that the phrasing of the text messages used in this study has a practically significant effect on vaccination rates.\n",

    "Bayesian analysis can significantly change our understanding of scientific research. We illustrated this by re-analyzing data from a highly-regarded study. Using Bayesian analysis, we showed that the study's original conclusion vastly overstated the effect of the top-performing treatment compared to the average treatment.\n",

# GHGA Metadata Utils

The GHGA Metadata Utils is a package that provides all things related to
the GHGA Metadata Schema.

The repository is structured to encourage,
- reuse of custom generators
- manage validation plugins


## Documentation:

An extensive documentation can be found [here](...) (coming soon).

## Quick Start
### Installation

```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
pip install .
```

## Development
For setting up the development environment, we rely on the
[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of vscode
in combination with Docker Compose.

To use it, you have to have Docker Compose as well as vscode with its "Remote - Containers" extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) installed.
Then open this repository in vscode and run the command
`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the vscode "Command Palette".

This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:
- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)
- all relevant vscode extensions pre-installed
- pre-configured linting and auto-formating
- a pre-configured debugger
- automatic license-header insertion

Moreover, inside the devcontainer, there are two convenience commands available
(please type them in the integrated terminal of vscode):
- `dev_install` - install the service with all development dependencies,
installs pre-commit, and applies any migration scripts to the test database
(please run that if you are starting the devcontainer for the first time
or if you added any python dependencies to the [`./setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg))

If you prefer not to use vscode, you could get a similar setup (without the editor specific features)
by running the following commands:
``` bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
cd ./.devcontainer

# build and run the environment with docker-compose
docker-compose up

# attach to the main container:
# (you can open multiple shell sessions like this)
docker exec -it devcontainer_app_1 /bin/bash
```

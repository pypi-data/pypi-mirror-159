class Variant:
    """
    A variant in a tree sequence, describing the observed genetic variation
    among samples for a given site. A variant consists of (a) the **alleles** that
    may be observed at the sample nodes for this site; (b) the **genotypes**
    mapping sample IDs to the observed alleles and (c) of a reference to
    the :class:`Site` that the Variant has been decoded at.

    After creation a Variant is not yet decoded, and has no genotypes.
    To decode a Variant, call the :meth:`decode` method. The Variant class will then
    use a Tree, internal to the Variant, to seek to the position of the site and decode
    the genotypes at that site. It is therefore much more efficient to sites in
    sequential genomic order, either in a forwards or backwards direction, than to do so
    randomly.

    Each element in the ``alleles`` tuple is a string, representing the
    actual observed state for a given sample. The ``alleles`` tuple is
    generated in one of two ways. The first (and default) way is for
    ``tskit`` to generate the encoding on the fly as alleles are encountered
    while generating genotypes. In this case, the first element of this
    tuple is guaranteed to be the same as the site's ``ancestral_state`` value
    and the list of alleles is also guaranteed not to contain any duplicates.
    Note that allelic values may be listed that are not referred to by any
    samples. For example, if we have a site that is fixed for the derived state
    (i.e., we have a mutation over the tree root), all genotypes will be 1, but
    the alleles list will be equal to ``('0', '1')``. Other than the
    ancestral state being the first allele, the alleles are listed in
    no particular order, and the ordering should not be relied upon
    (but see the notes on missing data below).

    The second way is for the user to define the mapping between
    genotype values and allelic state strings using the
    ``alleles`` parameter to the :meth:`TreeSequence.variants` method.
    In this case, there is no indication of which allele is the ancestral state,
    as the ordering is determined by the user.

    The ``genotypes`` represent the observed allelic states for each sample,
    such that ``var.alleles[var.genotypes[j]]`` gives the string allele
    for sample ID ``j``. Thus, the elements of the genotypes array are
    indexes into the ``alleles`` list. The genotypes are provided in this
    way via a numpy array to enable efficient calculations.

    When :ref:`missing data<sec_data_model_missing_data>` is present at a given
    site, the property ``has_missing_data`` will be True, at least one element
    of the ``genotypes`` array will be equal to ``tskit.MISSING_DATA``, and the
    last element of the ``alleles`` array will be ``None``. Note that in this
    case ``variant.num_alleles`` will **not** be equal to
    ``len(variant.alleles)``. The rationale for adding ``None`` to the end of
    the ``alleles`` list is to help code that does not handle missing data
    correctly fail early rather than introducing subtle and hard-to-find bugs.
    As ``tskit.MISSING_DATA`` is equal to -1, code that decodes genotypes into
    allelic values without taking missing data into account would otherwise
    incorrectly output the last allele in the list.

    :param TreeSequence tree_sequence: The tree sequence to which this variant
        belongs.
    :param array_like samples: An array of node IDs for which to generate
        genotypes, or None for all sample nodes. Default: None.
    :param bool isolated_as_missing: If True, the genotype value assigned to
        missing samples (i.e., isolated samples without mutations) is
        :data:`.MISSING_DATA` (-1). If False, missing samples will be
        assigned the allele index for the ancestral state.
        Default: True.
    :param tuple alleles: A tuple of strings defining the encoding of
        alleles as integer genotype values. At least one allele must be provided.
        If duplicate alleles are provided, output genotypes will always be
        encoded as the first occurrence of the allele. If None (the default),
        the alleles are encoded as they are encountered during genotype
        generation.

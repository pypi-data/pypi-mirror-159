# BrainBlocks TODO list

- Change `BitArray` class name to `BinaryPattern`
- Implement C++ HypergridTransformer
- Implement dendrite cleanup algorithm in SequenceLearner and ContextLearner
- Add short description of each block in their respective .cpp file
- Make num_t more intuitive (i.e. num_t=0 is current, num_t=1 is previous, num_t=2 is 2 time steps ago)
- Finish BitArray functions (low priority)

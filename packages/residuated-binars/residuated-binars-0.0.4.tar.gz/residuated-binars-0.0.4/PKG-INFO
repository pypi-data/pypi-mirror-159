This package serves for generating and validating examples of different algebraic structures using `Isabelle proof assistant <https://isabelle.in.tum.de>`__.

.. _how-to-install:

Dependencies
=============
Make sure that an installation of Isabelle is on the ``$PATH``

How to Install
===============

The best way to install ``residuated-binars`` is to use ``pip``::
  
    pip install residuated-binars
     
Alternatively, one can use Docker:

.. code:: sh

      docker build -t residuated-binars https://github.com/inpefess/residuated-binars.git
      docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 residuated-binars jupyter-lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser

Finally, one can run it on
`Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/inpefess/residuated-binars/HEAD?labpath=reproducing-residuated-binars-papers.ipynb>`__

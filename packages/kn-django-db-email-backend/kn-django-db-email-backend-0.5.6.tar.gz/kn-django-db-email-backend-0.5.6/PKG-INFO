Description: Django DB Email Backend
        =======================
        
        Initially, Django email backend for storing messages to a database. This is intended to be used in developement in cases where you
        want to test sending emails, but don't want to send real emails and don't have access to the console output (such as on
        a remote server).
        
        As this KUWAITNET fork, package has been updated and introduced `SMTPDBEmailBackend` which is a mixture between SMTP and DB mail backend,
        it writes to the database then send the email over smtp, if any errors happen while sending it is reflected in the email model.
        Also Package is now production ready.
        
        Access to Email message content is allowed only for superusers for security concerns.
        
        To install::
        
            pip install django-db-email-backend
        
        
        In settings.py::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS += ['db_email_backend']
            EMAIL_BACKEND = 'db_email_backend.backend.DBEmailBackend'
            # or for live
            # EMAIL_BACKEND = 'db_email_backend.backend.SMTPDBEmailBackend'
        
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        SMTP_EMAIL_FILTER_FUNCTION_PATH default to `db_email_backend.utils.smtp_filter_email_function`. a dotted path to the smtp email filter function.
        A filter function for the smtp email, takes the email_message as a parameter, and return Boolean. Case it returns False, then the backend won't send this message via smtp.
        You can use it to disallow SMTP sending for certain email based to their properties.

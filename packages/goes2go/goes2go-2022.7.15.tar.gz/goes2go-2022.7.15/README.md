GOES-East and GOES-West satellite data are made available on Amazon Web Services through [NOAA's Big Data Program](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/big-data). **GOES-2-go** is a python package that makes it easy to find and download the files you want to your local computer with some additional helpers to look at and understand the data.

# Capabilities

## Download Data

Download GOES ABI or GLM NetCDF files to your local computer. Files can also be read with xarray.

```python
from goes2go.data import goes_latest, goes_nearesttime
# Get latest data
G_ABI = goes_latest(satellite='G16', product='ABI')
# Get data for a specific time
G_GLM = goes_nearesttime('2021-01-01 12:00', satellite='G16', product='GLM')
```

## RGB Recipes

The `rgb` xarray accessor creates an RGB product for a GOES ABI multichannel xarray.Dataset. See the [demo](https://blaylockbk.github.io/goes2go/_build/html/user_guide/notebooks/DEMO_rgb_recipes.html#) for more examples of RGB products.

```python
from goes2go.data import goes_latest
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
G = goes_latest()
ax = plt.subplot(projection=G.rgb.crs)
ax.imshow(G.rgb.TrueColor(), **G.rgb.imshow_kwargs)
ax.coastlines()
```

## Field of View

The `FOV` xarray accessor creates shapely.Polygon objects for the ABI and GLM field of view. See notebooks for [GLM](https://blaylockbk.github.io/goes2go/_build/html/user_guide/notebooks/field-of-view_GLM.html) and [ABI](https://blaylockbk.github.io/goes2go/_build/html/user_guide/notebooks/field-of-view_ABI.html) field of view.

```python
from goes2go.data import goes_latest
G = goes_latest()
# Get polygons of the full disk or ABI domain field of view.
G.FOV.full_disk
G.FOV.domain
# Get Cartopy coordinate reference system
G.FOV.crs
```

GOES-West is centered over -137 W and GOES-East is centered over -75 W. When GOES was being tested, it was in a "central" position, outlined in the dashed black line. Below is the ABI field of view for the full disk:

The GLM field of view is slightly smaller and limited by a bounding box. Below is the approximated GLM field of view:

> As an alternative you can use [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to download GOES files from AWS. I quite like rclone. Here is a [short rclone tutorial](https://github.com/blaylockbk/pyBKB_v3/blob/master/rclone_howto.md).

I hope you find this makes GOES data easier to retrieve and display. Enjoy!

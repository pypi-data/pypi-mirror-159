    Returns a numpy array with a ETL ramp

    The waveform starts at offset and stays there for the delay period, then
    rises linearly to 2x amplitude (amplitude here refers to 1/2 peak-to-peak)
    and drops back down to the offset voltage during the fall period.

    Switching from a left to right ETL ramp is possible by exchanging the
    rise and fall periods.

    """
    Slow shutter, intended more as a gating device than a fast open/close because the
    NI task is recreated and deleted every time a shutter is actuated.

    Thus, the shutter has more a "gating" function to protect the sample than
    fast control of the laser, this is done via the laser intensity anyway.

    This uses the property of NI-DAQmx-outputs to keep their last digital state or
    analog voltage for as long the device is not powered down.

# MagicCube: A NxNxN Rubik Cube implementation
A fast implementation of the Rubik Cube based in Python 3.x. 

Allows creation of cubes of various sizes (2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 6x6x6, ...., 100x100x100).

Has a simple (not so efficient) solver for the 3x3x3 cube.


## Installation
```sh
pip install magiccube
```

## Usage
```python
import magiccube

# 3x3x3 Cube
cube = magiccube.Cube(3)
print(cube)
```
![Cube](https://trincaopub.s3.amazonaws.com/imgs/magiccube/cube3x3.png)

```python
# Rotate the cube
cube.rotate("R' L U D' F B' R' L")

# Solve the 3x3x3 cube
solver = BasicSolver(cube)
solver.solve()

# 6x6x6 Cube
cube = magiccube.Cube(6)
cube.rotate("Rw' Lw 3Uw'")
```

## Examples
See examples folder.

## Supported Moves and Notation
### Basic moves
|Move |                                                             |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|L L' | Clockwise/Counterclockwise cube rotation of the LEFT face.  |
|R R' | Clockwise/Counterclockwise cube rotation of the RIGHT face. |
|D D' | Clockwise/Counterclockwise cube rotation of the DOWN face.  |
|U U' | Clockwise/Counterclockwise cube rotation of the UP face.    |
|F F' | Clockwise/Counterclockwise cube rotation of the FRONT face. |
|B B' | Clockwise/Counterclockwise cube rotation of the BACK face.  |

### Advanced Moves
|Move |                                                             |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|X X' | Cube rotation on X axis. X is the axis that points from LEFT to the RIGHT face.|
|Y Y' | Cube rotation on Y axis. Y is the axis that points from DOWN to the UP face.|
|Z Z' | Cube rotation on Z axis. Z is the axis that points from BACK to the FRONT face.|
|Fw Fw'| Wide rotation of 2 layers.|
|3Fw 3Fw' | Wide rotation of 3 layers.|
|3F 3F' | Rotation of the 3rd layer.|

## Cube Coordinates

Cube coordinates are expressed as a tuple of x,y,z.

(0,0,0) is the piece on the LEFT,DOWN,BACK corner.

In a 3x3x3, (2,2,2) is the piece on the RIGH,UP,FRONT corner.

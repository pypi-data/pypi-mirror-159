About
-----

TimeSeriesX is motivated by handling time series data in a convenient way. Almost all the features are actually already
provided by `pandas`_. TimeSeriesX extends the pandas time series functionality by the unit functionalities of `pint`_ and `pint-pandas`_.
Further, TimeSeriesX offers an easy and convenient interface to work with time series without the need to
dig deep into these libraries, which nevertheless is still recommended, since they go way beyond time series data.

The main challenges that arise when handling time series data are time zones and frequencies. Since time series
data is often obtained by measurements, the values are associated with units. Then these units can be confused easily, since
the units are often not modeled in code.

TimeSeriesX forces the user to handle time zones, frequencies and units explicitly, while taking care
of validation and convenient formats. It also supports deriving these attributes from raw time series data.
It offers a limited set of actions on time series that are translated to pandas or pint functionality under the hood.
It was designed to guarantee that every transformation of time series data results in a new valid time series, which
would require quite some pandas code if done "manually".


Features
--------

* model time series data with explicit frequency, time zone and unit
* convert time zone or unit
* resample data to new frequency
* fill and get gaps
* join time series
* perform calculations on time series with python standard operators

=======
History
=======


0.1.13 (2022-07-19)
-------------------

* fix a few bugs by avoiding `is_compatible_with` in `convert_unit`
* raise only `ValueError` instead of `DimensionalityError` on unit dimensionality mismatch
* remove `pandas` installation dependency because of transitive dependency via `pint-pandas`
* loosen requirements for `pytz` and `dateutil`, no special version requirements known
* extend `__getitem__` functionality by supporting iterables of timestamps or positional indices
* explicitly support indexing by time zone naive timestamps, which is deprecated by `pandas`
* make `coerce_unit` behave like `coerce_freq` and `coerce_time_zone` by passing through `None`

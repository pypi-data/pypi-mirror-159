# PyEnzymeKinetics

Software-package for easy enzyme kinetic parameter estimation.
Supports EnzymeML format (not yet)
Allows comprehensive data analysis from experimental raw data to kinetic parameters

## Calibration

- linear and non-linear calibration for calculating concentrations from analytic signal (spectroscopy / HPLC)
- Selection of best fit model based on akaike-criterion

## Michaelis Menten kinetics

- Fitting of enzyme assay data Michaelis Menten equations for:
  - irreversible MM
  - enzyme inactivation
  - inhibition

Cable cell probing and sampling
===============================

.. module:: arbor

Cable cell probe addresses are defined analogously to their counterparts in
the C++ API (see :ref:`cablecell-probes` for details). Sample data recorded
by the Arbor simulation object is returned in the form of a NumPy array,
with the first column holding sample times, and subsequent columns holding
the corresponding scalar- or vector-valued sample.

Location expressions will be realised as zero or more specific sites on
a cell; probe addresses defined over location expressions will describe zero,
one, or more probes, one per site. They are evaluated in the context of
the cell on which the probe is attached.

Each of the functions described below generates an opaque :class:`probe`
object for use in the recipe :py:func:`recipe.probes` method.

More information on probes, probe metadata, and sampling can be found
in the documentation for the class :class:`simulation`.

   The value of the state variable ``state`` in the point process ``mechanism``
   associated with the target index ``target`` on the cell. If the given mechanism
   is not associated with the target index, no probe will be generated.

   Metadata: an object of type :class:`cable_point_probe_info`, comprising three fields:

   * ``target``: target index on the cell;

   * ``multiplicity``: number of targets sharing the same state in the discretization;

   * ``location``: :class:`location` object corresponding to the target site.
